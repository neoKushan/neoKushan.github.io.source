# Biography

Hi, I'm Steve.

My first experience tinkering with technology was probably when I reprogrammed the Satellite receiver to receive additional channels. My Dad was furious when he caught me, but he soon got over it when he realised just _how many_ more channels there were. I was 8 at the time.

It was inevitable that I'd go on to tinker with _real_ computers, figuring out what makes them tick and before you know it I'm a developer. 

Soon I'd go on to make my mark designing software for testing Chip & Pin devices; large multi-million £ e-commerce sites and even the odd dev-talk.

You'd think I'd stop there, but no, the Internet of Things happened so when I'm _not_ working, I'm busy trying to get my vacuum cleaner to talk to my cat-flap (No, really).

I don't just _like_ technology, I absolutely ❤ it. There's _probably_ something wrong with me.
