At the release of .NET Core 1.0, there was no way to trivially use bcrypt password hashing. A .NET library existed, but it had been abandoned by the author.

I took it upon myself to port this library to .NET Core. I have been maintaining it ever since and it is currently the most popular bcrypt library for .NET Core!

## Key Features

- Full bcrypt password hashing support for .NET Core
- Compatible with the original BCrypt.Net library
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Regular updates and maintenance
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Impact

This library has become the go-to solution for bcrypt password hashing in the .NET Core ecosystem, with millions of downloads and widespread adoption across enterprise and open-source projects.
