## The Short Version

I am a **Director of Software Engineering** with 17 years of experience, currently leading a remote-first department of **150+ engineers** across 18 squads.

I specialize in **scale**. whether that's scaling software architectures to handle thousands of enterprise tenants, scaling teams from local units to global powerhouses, or scaling release frequencies by **1500%**.

## My Journey

My career didn't start in a computer lab; it started in my parents' living room at age 8. I reprogrammed the family satellite receiver to unlock more channels. My Dad was furious until he saw the selection - then he just asked for the remote.

That curiosity never left. It evolved from hacking hardware to building enterprise software, architecting Chip & Pin solutions, and now, defining technical strategy for global SaaS platforms.

Currently, at **SS&C Blue Prism**, I own the engineering delivery across the entire product portfolio. This involves a delicate balancing act: maintaining the "Current Gen" revenue drivers while architecting the "Next-Gen" cloud-native future.

## Impact by the Numbers

I believe engineering leadership is measured by outcomes, not just output. Some highlights from my recent work include:

* **150+** - Engineers, Managers, and Leads in my current department.
* **500%** - Increase in release cycle speed achieved through modern CI/CD.
* **15x** - Increase in deployment frequency by shifting to a "DevOps First" mindset.
* **300%** - Expansion of the engineering department engineered via global recruitment.

## How I Lead

While I focus on strategy today, I remain deeply technical. I believe you cannot direct what you do not understand. Then again, Technology is easy; it's people that are hard. My leadership philosophy is built on three pillars:

1.  **Psychological Safety**: Innovation requires failure. I build cultures where teams feel safe to experiment, providing they learn from the result.
2.  **Autonomy with Alignment**: I set the destination (Strategy) and the guardrails (Standards), then trust my leaders to find the best route.
3.  **Commercial Awareness**: Engineering is expensive. I champion **FinOps** strategies to ensure every line of code we ship drives measurable business value.

## Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not optimizing pipelines or mentoring leaders, I am usually:

* 🐈 Wrangling my 4 cats.
* 🎮 Gaming on Steam (Ask me about my current obsession).
* 🥐 Baking (Engineering you can eat).
* 🤖 **The IoT Battle:** I spend an unhealthy amount of time trying to get my vacuum cleaner to negotiate a peace treaty with my cat-flap.
* 🖨️ 3D Printing: Turning perfectly good spools of filament into 'abstract art' (and occasionally useful parts).

I am always open to discussing engineering leadership, the future of AI in education, or the nuances of legacy migration.
